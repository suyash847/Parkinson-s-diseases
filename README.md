Early Detection of Parkinson's Disease<br>
Overview<br>
This project aims to develop and evaluate methods for the early detection of Parkinson's Disease (PD) using data-driven approaches. By leveraging machine learning models and clinical data, the goal is to identify early warning signs and support timely diagnosis and intervention.<br><br>

Features<br>
Data Analysis: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in patient data.<br>
Machine Learning Models: Classification models to predict Parkinson's Disease based on motor and non-motor features.<br>
Interactive Tools: Tools for visualizing results and identifying key biomarkers.<br>
Integration: Compatibility with clinical workflows for practical usage.<br>
Technologies Used<br>
Programming Languages: Python<br>
Libraries/Frameworks: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Matplotlib, Seaborn<br>
Data Sources: Public datasets like the UCI Parkinson's dataset or custom-collected data<br>
Version Control: Git and GitHub<br>
Installation<br>
Clone the repository:<br>
bash<br>
Copy code<br>
git clone https://github.com/suyash847/Early-Parkinson-Detection.git  <br>
cd Early-Parkinson-Detection  <br>
Install dependencies:<br>
bash<br>
Copy code<br>
